# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Machine Learning Types

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data, helping to make predictions or decisions based on that data. Common examples include:
- Image classification
- Spam detection
- Price prediction

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Applications include:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Dimensionality reduction

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors. Used in:
- Game playing (AlphaGo, Chess engines)
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning using neural networks with multiple layers. Key architectures include:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data
- Transformers for natural language processing

## Applications

Modern AI and ML are used across many industries:
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Self-driving cars, route optimization
- Entertainment: Content recommendation, game AI

## Ethical Considerations

As AI systems become more powerful, important ethical considerations include:
- Bias and fairness in algorithms
- Privacy and data protection
- Transparency and explainability
- Job displacement and economic impact
