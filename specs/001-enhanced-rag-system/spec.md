# Feature Specification: Full-Featured RAG System with Comprehensive File Type Support

**Feature Branch**: `[001-full-featured-rag-system]`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Enhanced
**Input**: Enhance the existing PDF-based RAG system to support comprehensive file type coverage (excluding Microsoft documents), with advanced chunking strategies, web content support, configuration management, and production-ready features

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A knowledge worker needs to search across a diverse collection of documents including PDFs, web pages, code repositories, configuration files, data files, and various text formats to get comprehensive answers that synthesize information from all relevant sources while maintaining conversation context.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has documents in multiple formats (PDF, JSON, CSV, Markdown, source code, config files), **When** they ask a question, **Then** the system must search across all supported document types and return context-aware answers
2. **Given** a user processes large document collections, **When** they load documents, **Then** the system must automatically detect file types, apply optimal processing strategies, and handle large files efficiently
3. **Given** a user works with structured data, **When** they process JSON/XML/CSV files, **Then** the system must preserve data structure and relationships in the extracted text
4. **Given** a user searches code repositories, **When** they ask technical questions, **Then** the system must provide syntax-aware answers with code context and function references
5. **Given** a user needs different processing for different content types, **When** they configure settings, **Then** the system must apply appropriate chunking strategies (semantic for code, paragraph for docs, structured for data)
6. **Given** a user asks follow-up questions, **When** they interact with the system, **Then** the system must maintain conversation context and reference previous answers across all document types

### Edge Cases
- How does system handle mixed-language documents?
- What happens with extremely large files (>1GB)?
- How does system handle corrupted or malformed files?
- What happens when external dependencies (web content, APIs) become unavailable?
- How does system handle documents with embedded binary content?
- What happens with files that have no extractable text content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support comprehensive file type processing including PDF, JSON, CSV, XML, YAML, TOML, Markdown, HTML, source code files, configuration files, RTF, eBooks, log files, and audio transcripts
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically detect file type and apply optimal processing strategy with fallback mechanisms
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide intelligent chunking strategies: semantic for source code, paragraph for documents, structured for data files, and hybrid approaches for mixed content
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain conversation context across multiple user queries with configurable history limits and cross-document reference tracking
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide unified search and retrieval across all indexed document types with relevance scoring and source attribution
- **FR-006**: System MUST support advanced configuration management including file type enable/disable, processing parameters, and performance tuning
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle document updates, incremental indexing, and cache invalidation when source documents change
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide detailed feedback on document processing status, progress tracking, and comprehensive error reporting
- **FR-009**: System MUST support structured data preservation for JSON, XML, CSV, YAML, and TOML files maintaining data relationships
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide syntax-aware processing for source code files including language detection, function extraction, and comment analysis
- **FR-011**: System MUST support large file processing with streaming, memory management, and configurable resource limits
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide batch processing capabilities for document collections with progress monitoring and resume capability
- **FR-013**: System MUST support content extraction from web pages including JavaScript rendering options and metadata preservation
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide export/import capabilities for document collections, conversation history, and configuration profiles

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Document**: Represents any source file (PDF, JSON, CSV, source code, web content, etc.) with comprehensive metadata, processing status, and content type classification
- **Document Chunk**: A logical segment of a document optimized for embedding and retrieval, maintaining context boundaries, preserving structure for data files, and including syntax information for code
- **File Type Processor**: Specialized handler for specific file formats with extraction strategies, metadata capabilities, and performance characteristics
- **Processing Batch**: Group of documents processed together with progress tracking, error handling, and resume capabilities
- **Conversation Session**: Tracks user interaction history, cross-document references, and context for providing coherent follow-up responses across all document types
- **Configuration Profile**: Comprehensive settings for file type enable/disable, processing parameters, chunking strategies, performance tuning, and resource limits
- **Search Result**: Relevant document chunks ranked by relevance to user queries with detailed source attribution, file type indicators, and content context
- **Content Extractor**: Specialized component for extracting text content from different file types with structure preservation and metadata extraction
