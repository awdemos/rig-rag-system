# Research: Enhanced RAG System

## Technical Research Findings

### Web Content Processing
**Decision**: Use `reqwest` for HTTP client + `scraper` for HTML parsing
**Rationale**:
- `reqwest` is the de facto HTTP client in Rust ecosystem
- `scraper` provides HTML5 parsing and CSS selector support
- Both are well-maintained and have good documentation
**Alternatives considered**:
- `curl` + `html5ever` (more complex, lower level)
- `surf` (less mature ecosystem)

### Document Chunking Strategies
**Decision**: Implement multiple strategies based on document type
**Rationale**:
- Different document types benefit from different chunking approaches
- PDF: Fixed character chunks with paragraph awareness
- Text: Semantic chunking based on punctuation and structure
- Web: Content-aware chunking preserving HTML structure
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single chunking strategy for all (less effective)
- ML-based chunking (overkill for this scope)

### Conversation Context Management
**Decision**: Use in-memory conversation sessions with configurable history limits
**Rationale**:
- Simple and efficient for CLI application
- Configurable limits prevent memory bloat
- Easy to implement and test
**Alternatives considered**:
- Persistent conversation storage (overkill for CLI)
- Database-backed sessions (unnecessary complexity)

### Configuration Management
**Decision**: JSON configuration files with environment variable overrides
**Rationale**:
- JSON is human-readable and easily editable
- Environment variables allow for deployment-specific settings
- Follows Rust ecosystem conventions
**Alternatives considered**:
- TOML configuration (good alternative, but JSON is more universal)
- Command-line arguments only (less flexible for complex configs)

### Performance Optimization
**Decision**:
- Streaming document processing for large files
- Lazy loading of document chunks
- Configurable batch sizes for embedding generation
**Rationale**:
- Prevents memory issues with large documents
- Provides good balance between performance and memory usage
- Allows users to tune based on their hardware

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Structured error types with `thiserror` + comprehensive logging
**Rationale**:
- `thiserror` provides clean error type definitions
- Structured logging helps with debugging
- Graceful degradation for non-critical errors
**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple string errors (less informative)
- Panic-based error handling (not user-friendly)

## Dependencies Research

### New Dependencies to Add
- `reqwest`: HTTP client for web content
- `scraper`: HTML parsing library
- `thiserror`: Error handling
- `tracing`: Structured logging
- `serde_json`: JSON processing (enhanced)
- `clap`: Enhanced CLI argument parsing
- `dirs`: Configuration directory discovery

### Existing Dependencies to Keep
- `rig-core`: Core RAG functionality
- `tokio`: Async runtime
- `anyhow`: Error handling (complementary to thiserror)
- `serde`: Serialization

## Integration Strategy

### Document Processor Module
- Trait-based design for different document types
- Factory pattern for document type detection
- Streaming processing for memory efficiency

### Configuration System
- Layered configuration (defaults → file → env vars)
- Hot-reload capability for development
- Validation and default value handling

### Conversation Management
- Session-based approach with configurable retention
- Context window management for LLM queries
- Export/import capability for conversation persistence

## Testing Strategy

### Contract Testing
- OpenAPI specification for HTTP endpoints
- Request/response validation
- Integration with existing Rig framework contracts

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end document processing workflows
- Conversation flow testing
- Configuration validation testing

### Performance Testing
- Large document processing benchmarks
- Memory usage profiling
- Response time metrics

## Security Considerations

### Web Content Security
- Input validation for URLs
- Safe HTML parsing to prevent XSS
- Rate limiting for web requests

### Configuration Security
- Sensitive data handling (API keys)
- File permission validation
- Configuration file encryption option

### Data Privacy
- Local-only processing (no cloud uploads)
- User data isolation
- Secure temporary file handling

## Performance Targets

### Document Processing
- < 30s for 100-page PDF
- < 5s for typical web page
- Memory usage < 500MB for large documents

### Query Response
- < 2s for typical queries
- < 5s for complex multi-document queries
- Support for concurrent queries

### System Resources
- CPU usage < 50% during indexing
- Memory usage < 1GB baseline
- Disk usage for cached embeddings configurable
